# Trinity Hackathon - Data Science & Data Analytics

## Team: SEEKERS
- **Team Leader:** Eswara Manikanta Chandra Prasad Perumalla
- **Team Members:** Teja Dalayai, Abhinash Gunda, Hanumanth Kumar M

## Objective
Understand the impact of Payers (Insurers) on treatment preferences of patients and physicians. The insights aim to help pharmaceutical companies engage key Payers or Plans, enhancing drug adoption as a preferred treatment option. Analysis includes segmentation by geography, patient age, payment type, and physician preferences.

## Problem Statement
Develop innovative product concepts leveraging analytical and AI techniques to drive value in the life sciences domain.

## Proposed Solution
A personalized medical recommendation system providing individualized healthcare insights, including disease predictions, adaptive workouts, dietary recommendations, and medication guidelines based on user symptoms.

## Approach

1. **Section 1: Patient Demographics Analysis**
   - Analyzed average patient age differences for each drug.

2. **Section 2: Claim Trends and HCP Analysis**
   - Generated line charts illustrating trends in claim submissions over time for different payment types.

3. **Section 3: HCP Segmentation**
   - Performed segmentation analysis on HCPs to categorize them based on prescription patterns and preferences.

4. **Section 4: Geographic and Demographic Insights**
   - Identified potential geographic regions and patient demographics for effective drug promotion.
